* the self-signed certificate is signed by the same party that owns the private key, while the 
* digital identity certificate returned by the certificate authority upon receiving the certificate 
* signing request is signed using the certificate authority's private key.
* 
* That is correct.
* 
* Therefore the self-signed certificate is guaranteed to work for encryption but not identification, 
* while the digital identification certificate from the certificate authority is guaranteed to work * for encryption and identification.
* 
* This gets kinda tricky. The CA signed cert is only trusted for identification because the CA is 
* include in the pre-populated certificate store built into browsers/OS. If I didn't have a *
* pre-populated certificate store neither of them would be trusted.
* 
* If I downloaded and verified certificate of that self-signed key and added it to my certificate 
* store, then I could trust it for all purposes.
*
* So from the point of view of the technology the only difference is that your self-signed cert 
* wouldn't be built into my browser/OS.
